Arduino Powered LED Control System

This project allows Neopixel compatabile LEDs to be connected to an arduino and have their colors controlled. This project allows the configuration of the initial color, which values are being changed (R, G, B), and how quickly/by how much. An implementation of this project is to use an arduino nano with LEDs to add colorful lighting to a Desktop case, or under a table.
